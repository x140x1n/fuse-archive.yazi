[fuse-archive.yazi](https://github.com/x140x1n/fuse-archive.yazi)
uses [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive) to
transparently mount and unmount archives in read-only mode, allowing you to
navigate inside, view, and extract individual or groups of files.

There is another plugin on which this one is based,
[archivemount.yazi](https://github.com/AnirudhG07/archivemount.yazi). It
mounts archives with read and write permissions. The main problem is it uses
[archivemount](https://github.com/cybernoid/archivemount) which is much slower
than [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive).
It also supports very few file types compared to this plugin, and you need to
mount and unmount the archives manually.

[fuse-archive.yazi](https://github.com/x140x1n/fuse-archive.yazi) supports mounting the following file extensions: [SUPPORTED ARCHIVE FORMATS](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive?tab=readme-ov-file#archive-formats)

## What's new in this fork

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Minimum version: yazi v25.5.31.
>
> Password-protected RAR files are not supported yet!

### Keep the file mount

By using `plugin fuse-archive -- leave`. So you can copy and paste
the content to another place without opening a new tab.

### Support multiple deep mount

That means, if you have a file like below,
just use `plugin fuse-archive -- mount` to go deeper inside
and `plugin fuse-archive -- leave` to go back. Even if the files inside are password-protected,
it will still prompt you to enter a password. You only need to enter the password once for each file.

- Origin file.zip
  - Child_1.zip
    - Grandchild_1.zip
  - Child_2.zip (with password)
    - Grandchild_2.zip (with another password)
      - GranGrandchild_3.zip (with another password)

### Support mountoptions

You can use `plugin fuse-archive -- mount` with mount options. Add `mount_options` option to `setup()` function.

### Exclude extensions

Using `excluded_extensions` option, you can exclude some extensions from mounting.

### Support MacOS

This plugin supports MacOS, but you need to install `macfuse` instead of `fuse3`.

### Mount management actions

The plugin provides several actions for managing mounted archives:

- **`jump`** — Show a picker of mounted archives and jump to the selected one.
- **`select-then-unmount`** — Show a picker of mounted archives and unmount the selected one.
- **`unmount-all`** — Unmount all currently mounted archives.
- **`menu`** — Show an interactive menu with unmount and unmount-all options.

### Lazy unmount for busy mounts

When unmounting an archive that is still in use (e.g. your cwd is inside it), the plugin
automatically redirects all tabs out of the mount point and falls back to `fusermount -uz`
(lazy unmount) if the mount is still busy. This ensures unmounting always succeeds.

### Automatic unmount on quit

For yazi >= v25.12.29, the plugin automatically hooks into quit events (`key-quit`,
`emit-quit`, `emit-ind-quit`) to unmount all archives on exit. No extra keymap
configuration is needed.

## Requirements

1. [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi).

2. This plugin only supports Linux and MacOS, and requires having latest
   [fuse-archive](https://github.com/google/fuse-archive), [xxHash](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash) and `fuse3` for Linux, and [macfuse](https://github.com/macfuse/macfuse/releases) for macOS installed.
   This fork requires you to build and install fuse-archive with latest
   source from github (because the latest released version in some distros is too old, 2020).

## Installation

### Dependencies:

- For Ubuntu:

  Use `libfuse3-dev` instead of `libfuse-dev` if you are using Ubuntu 22.04 or later.
  - libfuse-dev: This is for FUSE 2.x, the older version.
  - libfuse3-dev: This is for FUSE 3.x, the newer and actively developed version,
    which is recommended by fuse-archive's author.

  ```sh
  sudo apt install git cmake g++ pkg-config libfuse3-dev libarchive-dev libboost-all-dev xxhash fuse3
  git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  cd "fuse-archive"
  sudo make install
  ```

- For Arch based:

  ```sh
  yay -S xxhash fuse3 fuse-archive

  # or: paru -S xxhash fuse3 fuse-archive

  # Or: install fuse-archive from source:
  # git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  # cd "fuse-archive"
  # sudo make install
  ```

- For other distros, it's better to use ChatGPT for dependencies. Prompt: `install fuse-archive YOUR_DISTRO_NAME`.

- For macOS (only for fuse-archive >= v1.17):
  - You can install `macfuse` and `xxhash` with `brew install macfuse xxhash`.
  - Then install `fuse-archive`:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/google/fuse-archive
  cd "fuse-archive"
  # Not tested yet, please confirm if it works.
  sudo CXXFLAGS=-DFUSE_DARWIN_ENABLE_EXTENSIONS=0 make STD=gnu++20a install
  ```

- Fuse-archive also relies on the availability of the following filter programs: `base64`, `brotli`, `compress`, `lrzip`, `lzop` and `grzip` for supporting those compression formats.

### fuse-archive.yazi:

```sh
ya pkg add x140x1n/fuse-archive
```

Modify your `~/.config/yazi/init.lua` to include:

```lua
require("fuse-archive"):setup()
```

### Setup options

The plugin supports the following options, which can be assigned during setup:

1. (optional) `smart_enter`: If `true`, when _entering_ a file it will be _opened_, while
   directories will always be _entered_. The default value is `false`.

2. (optional) `excluded_extensions`: A list of extensions that will be excluded from mounting.

3. (optional) `extra_extensions`: A list of extensions to add to the supported mount list.
   This is useful if you want to mount an archive format that I may have missed or was unaware it is supported by fuse-archive.

4. (optional) `mount_options`: String of mount options to be used when mounting the archive, separated by comma or space.
   List of options: `fuse-archive -h`

5. (optional) `mount_root_dir`: Full path of the directory where you want to mount the archive. Default is `/tmp`.

```lua
require("fuse-archive"):setup({
  smart_enter = true,
  excluded_extensions = { "deb", "apk", "rpm" },
  extra_extensions = { "xyz" },
  mount_options = "nocache,nosymlinks",
  mount_root_dir = os.getenv("HOME") .. "/abc_folder",
})
```

## Key mapping

The plugin works transparently, so for the best effect, remap your navigation
keys assigned to `enter` and `leave` to the plugin. This way you will be able
to "navigate" compressed archives as if they were part of the file system.

When you _enter_ an archive, the plugin mounts it and takes you to the mounted
directory, and when you _leave_, it won't unmount the archive but takes you back to
the original location of the archive. For yazi >= v25.12.29, all mounted archives
are automatically unmounted when you quit yazi — no extra keymap configuration required.

Add this to your `~/.config/yazi/keymap.toml`:

```toml
[mgr]
prepend_keymap = [
    { on = [ "l" ],      run = "plugin fuse-archive -- mount",               desc = "Enter or mount archive" },
    { on = [ "h" ],      run = "plugin fuse-archive -- leave",               desc = "Leave archive (keep mounted)" },
    { on = [ "F", "u" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- select-then-unmount", desc = "Select archive to unmount" },
    { on = [ "F", "U" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- unmount-all",         desc = "Unmount all archives" },
    { on = [ "g", "a" ], run = "plugin fuse-archive -- jump",                desc = "Jump to mounted archive" },
]
```

### Actions

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `mount` | Enter a directory or mount the selected archive and navigate into it. |
| `leave` | Leave the current mount point back to the archive's original location (keeps it mounted). |
| `unmount` | Unmount all mounted archives (same as `unmount-all`). |
| `jump` | Show a picker of all mounted archives and jump to the selected one. |
| `select-then-unmount` | Show a picker of all mounted archives and unmount the selected one. |
| `unmount-all` | Unmount all currently mounted archives. |
| `menu` | Show an interactive menu with unmount and unmount-all options. |

> [!NOTE]
> For yazi <= v25.5.31, you need to manually unmount before quitting:
>
> ```toml
> { on = [ "q" ], run = ["plugin fuse-archive -- unmount", "quit"], desc = "Quit" },
> ```
>
> For yazi >= v25.12.29, this is handled automatically via quit hooks.

When the current file is not a supported archive type, the plugin simply calls
_enter_, and when there is nothing to unmount, it calls _leave_, so it works
transparently.

In case you run into any problems and need to unmount something manually, or
delete any temporary directories, the location of the mounts is one of the
following:

1. `/tmp/yazi/fuse-archive/...` by default.
2. Or if you set `mount_root_dir` option in `setup()` function, it will be
   `mount_root_dir/yazi/fuse-archive/...` in your `mount_root_dir` directory.
